Explore the rationality of the supply and demand of medical resources in fever clinic in Jinshan Street in Fuzhou.

## Description:
The covid-19 virus is getting serious at present. It is obvious that the medical resource could not meet with the increasing need. Therefore, we aim to explore how to distribute medical resource to ensure the health of the population in Jinshan Street to the greatest extent possible. In our project, medical resource is reflected in fever clinics. The overall health condition is evaluated by local severe cases.

2. [x] Population of communities in Jinshan Street (✔ found in the official account)
3. [ ] Scale of fever clinics in Jinshan Street (How many people are served everyday) ❌

    a) By field observation, count the number of clients per hour.
